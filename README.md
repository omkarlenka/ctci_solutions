# ctci_solutions
Welcome to the ctci_solutions!

This repository is maintained to upload my solutions for the problems from book cracking the coding interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

There are no language restrictions on solutions as of now when I'm writing this though all solutions till now are in python.

My preferred languages for solving data structure and algorithm problems are:
1.C++
2.Python
3.C
